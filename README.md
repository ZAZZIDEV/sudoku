# Implementations of three Sudoku Solving algorithms
**This is part of the Matura Project of Leandro Zazzi.**  
This is the Source Code of the implementations of the analyzed algorithms. 
The three algorithms that were analyzed are:
1. Native backtracking Algorithm
1. Optimized Backtracking Algorithm
1. Algorithm X



## Running the tests yourself

performance.py contains all the tests...
